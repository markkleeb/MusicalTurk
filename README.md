##Musical Turk

###A crowd-sourced musical composition

Musical Turk is a place where people can upload musical samples that will later be incorporated into a live performance. There are several categories that have a few instructions for uploading, but most of the creative control is left up to the user. During the performance, an application will download all of the samples from the website and use them along with live musicians to create new compositions. Because the samples are always changing, no two performances will sound the same.
